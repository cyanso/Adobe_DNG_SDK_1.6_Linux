To build the DNG SDK, you also need to download and install the libjpeg package. It is available from:

http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v9c.tar.gz

or

http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsr9c.zip

Move the contents of the "jpeg-9c" folder into the "libjpeg" folder.

The DNG SDK includes a pre-built "jconfig.h" which works on Macintosh and Windows.
